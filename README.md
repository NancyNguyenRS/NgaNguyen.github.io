# NgaNguyen.github.io
Welcome to Nga Nguyen 's webpage!
On this site, I post information on my related research and publication in geo-information, Earth observation (especially open data source) and data analysis as well as relevant academic papers and projects. My goal is to provide an open scientific source to communicate to the public and search for a chance to cooperate with natural resource managers to support ecosystem management and conservation. 

You will find more about the on-going or past projects since I started my career as a researcher in the page PROJECTS. My RESEARCH BLOGS is where I share information about my current work and update analysis approaches that I felt interested in. All contents are the original work of NGA NGUYEN. If you have any questions, feel free to CONTACT me.
